    <p>But here's what most couples don't realize: <strong>it's not about having more money</strong>. It's about having a system that removes the stress, confusion, and arguments that money brings into relationships.</p>

    <h2><span class="move-icon">üéØ</span>Move 1: Create a Shared Vision</h2>
    
    <div class="quote-box">
        <p class="quote-text">Without a vision the people perish.</p>
        <p class="quote-author">‚Äî Bible</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Most couples argue about money because they're rowing in different directions. One wants to save for a house, the other wants to travel. One prioritizes security, the other values experiences.</p>
    
    <p><strong>The solution isn't compromise‚Äîit's alignment.</strong></p>
    
    <p>When you create a shared vision, money becomes a tool to achieve your dreams together, not a source of conflict. You need to know where you're going before you can plan how to get there.</p>
    
    <div class="example-box">
        <h3>üèÜ Real Example: Sarah & Mike's Vision</h3>
        <p><strong>Shared Dream:</strong> Own a home with a workshop (for Mike's woodworking) and a garden (for Sarah's passion) within 5 years, while maintaining their love for weekend getaways.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> Instead of arguing about Mike's tool purchases or Sarah's travel spending, they created specific savings goals that honored both priorities.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Your shared vision becomes your North Star. Every financial decision gets easier when you can ask: "Does this move us closer to our vision or further away?"</p>
    
    <div class="action-step">
        <h3>üí° Action Step #1</h3>
        <p>Schedule a "Vision Date" this week. Each partner writes down 3 dreams for the next 5-10 years. Share them without judgment, then find the common threads. Create one sentence that captures your shared financial vision.</p>

    <p>Forget complicated spreadsheets. The <strong>50/30/15/5 rule</strong> is the simplest system for couples who want to build wealth without constant money stress.</p>
    
    <div class="example-box">

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Lifestyle</strong> (dining, entertainment, fun)</td>
                <td>30%</td>
                <td>$1,500</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Investments</strong> (retirement, index funds)</td>
                <td>15%</td>
                <td>$750</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Savings Goals</strong> (house, vacation, emergency)</td>

                <td>$250</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
    
    <p>This system works because it's <strong>guilt-free</strong>. You both know exactly how much you can spend on lifestyle without touching your future. No more "Should we really buy this?" conversations.</p>

    </div>
    
    <p>The couples who build the most wealth don't rely on willpower‚Äîthey rely on systems. Automation removes the emotional decision-making that destroys financial progress.</p>

        <h3>üí° Action Step #3</h3>
        <p>Set up automatic transfers this week: 15% to investment accounts, 5% to savings goals. Start with whatever amount you can, even if it's $25/week. The habit matters more than the amount.</p>

    <p>Not all debt is created equal. Your mortgage? That's building wealth. Your credit cards at 24% interest? That's wealth destruction on steroids.</p>
    
    <p><strong>The Debt Avalanche Method:</strong> List all debts by interest rate (highest first). Pay minimums on everything, then throw every extra dollar at the highest rate debt. It's mathematically optimal and psychologically powerful when you tackle it as a team.</p>
    
    <div class="example-box">
        <h3>üèîÔ∏è Debt Avalanche in Action</h3>
        <p><strong>Credit Card:</strong> $8,000 at 22% interest<br>
        <strong>Car Loan:</strong> $15,000 at 6% interest<br>
        <strong>Student Loan:</strong> $25,000 at 4% interest</p>
        
        <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Attack the credit card first while paying minimums on the others. This saves thousands in interest and creates momentum.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Here's the relationship secret: <strong>tackle debt together, celebrate victories together.</strong> Make it a team sport, not a source of shame. Every extra payment is a win for your future selves.</p>

        <h3>üí° Action Step #4</h3>
        <p>List all your debts by interest rate. Commit to paying an extra $100-500/month toward the highest rate debt. Set a target payoff date and celebrate milestones together.</p>
